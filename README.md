# Release
This is an example of my proposed release cycle.

## Workflows
### Check Branch Name
Check branch name makes sure any branch merged into staging is like EX-111_branch_description
the first part being your jira ticket EX-111

### Create Release
Creates a github release to be deployed with generated changelog.

### Rebase on Release
As code moves through stages it collects minor changes, this merges codes final form back into dev stages.

## Developer Flow

 - Write code in PRs only
 - Test in develop Branch
 - [Not Implemented] On Jira ticket moved to review, create staging pr
 - At end of Sprint choose branches to be included in next release
 - Merge and delete those branches into staging
 - Manually create release with `DEBUG=release-it:* release-it patch --preRelease=staging --no-npm --github.release=true`
 - Make sure all items in RC are tested by end of next sprint
 - Merge RC tag into Main to create official release
 - Deploy to prod
 
 ## TODO
 
 - Add jira [webhook](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/webhooks/) and jira [workflow](https://github.com/parkhub/save-repo-for-jira-action/blob/master/index.js) for tracking branches 
 - Setup Template for changelog
 - Match Pre Release and release changelog or at least reference
 
Changelog goal is something like so:
