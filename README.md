# Release
This is an example of my proposed release cycle.

## Workflows
### Check Branch Name
Check branch name makes sure any branch merged into staging is like EX-111_branch_description
the first part being your jira ticket EX-111

### Create Release Candidate
Creating the release candidate means that anything merged here will be considered releasable upon final testing
